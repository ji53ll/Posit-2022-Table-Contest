# Posit-2022-Table-Contest

Here is a repository for the Construction Spending Tables and Data Visualizations I have created with the help of Tidyverse>Dplyr, GT, GTExtras, Sparkline and Rio packages. This is my Posit 2022 Table Contest Entry.

#####IMPORTANT NOTE: The df1 data set is a live link from the U.S. Census Bureau website that updates on a certain schedule every month (i.e Nov 1st, Dec 1st, etc.. While the code for the tables and charts does indeed update based on this live link, it is very important to properly refresh links to the merged df2 & df3 because the data sets only capture a few months at a time and were spliced to create a year's worth of data. You may need to link to different data sets on the US Census Bureau website. You will also need to rename the columns and remake the annotations to match the latest data. Otherwise, you will risk not capturing a full years worth of data, or it will be refreshed data that is improperly labeled...An alternative option is to simply reference the excel files in a static way if you are not concerned with an automatically updating table over time. Please refer to the U.S. Census Bureau website for any details regarding the data sets.
